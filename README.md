# ARCH Hospital Management System

## Overview
The **ARCH Hospital Management System** is a project developed using the C programming language for our Data Structure course. This system aims to streamline various hospital management processes, such as managing doctor information, booking appointments, and handling payments. The project leverages key data structure concepts to provide efficient and reliable functionality.

## Team Members
- **Leader & Lead Developer:Kh. Rzve Reza**  
- **Assistant Developer:*Fhad Sarkar*  
- **UI/UX Designer:*Mahamudul Hasan*  
- **Marketing Manager:*Satu Chandra Bhowmik*
- **System Analyst:*Md. Chand Mandal*

## Features
1. **Doctor Information Management**  
   - Reads and displays doctor's information from `doctors.txt`.

2. **Appointment Booking**  
   - Allows users to book appointments with available doctors.  
   - Users provide their name, age, and disease details for booking.

3. **Payment Processing**  
   - Facilitates completion of payments for booked appointments.

4. **User Panel**  
   - A user-friendly interface for accessing the above features.

5. **Admin Panel**  
   - Provides administrative control to manage doctor and patient records.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C
- **Data Structures:** Arrays, Linked Lists, File Handling

## File Structure
- `main.c`: The primary code file for the project.
- `doctors.txt`: Contains information about the doctors.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## How to Run the Program
1. **Pre-requisites:** Ensure you have a C compiler installed, such as GCC.
2. **Compile the Code:**
   ```
   gcc main.c -o hospital_management
   ```
3. **Run the Executable:**
   ```
   ./hospital_management
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to use the system.

## Data Structure Concepts Implemented
- **File Handling:** To read and write doctor and user data.
- **Linked Lists:** To manage dynamic data such as appointments.
- **Arrays:** For managing static data such as fixed doctor information.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement database integration for more robust data storage.
- Enhance the UI/UX for improved user experience.
